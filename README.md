**Creative Technologist. Martech by day.**

I care about craftsmanship. I don't like buzzwords.

### Theses I'm Working Through

**Devices as Co-Creations** — There's power in opening up whatever you're building to the public. Memes, open source, CAD/CAM.

**The Future Belongs to the Storytellers** — The moment something becomes automated, so too does it become artisanal. When everything is made by AI, the funny, janky and obscene will stand out among the slop.

**Better Discovery Engines for Digital Culture** — Engagement-based algorithms got us stuck in a loop. We can build more efficient discovery if we lean on people's relationships for our feeds.
